One chilly February afternoon, Emily was visiting her Grandma Rose’s house. The sweet scent of cinnamon cookies filled the air as she sat at the kitchen table, sipping warm cocoa.

“Grandma,” Emily said, “Valentine’s Day is coming up, and I want to make the best card ever! But I don’t know what to write. Do you think Valentine’s Day is only for sweethearts?”

Grandma Rose chuckled. “Oh, no, my dear. Valentine’s Day is about love in all forms—family, friends, and special people who touch our hearts.”

Emily took a bite of her cookie, deep in thought. “Have you ever gotten a really special Valentine?”

Grandma’s eyes twinkled. “In fact, I have. Would you like to see it?”

Emily nodded eagerly.

Grandma led her up the creaky attic stairs. The attic smelled of old books and memories. Sunlight peeked through a round window, casting a warm glow over the wooden floor. Grandma walked over to an old wooden chest, lifted the lid, and carefully pulled out a small, faded pink envelope.

“This,” she said, handing it to Emily, “is my most special Valentine.”

Emily carefully opened the envelope. Inside was a beautiful, hand-drawn Valentine’s Day card with delicate lace edges. The words inside read:

“To my dearest Rose,
Your smile brightens my days,
Your laughter is my favorite melody,
And you will always have my heart.
Forever yours, Thomas.”

Emily looked up in surprise. “Who’s Thomas?”

Grandma smiled wistfully and sat down on an old rocking chair. “Thomas was my very best friend when I was your age. We lived in the same neighborhood, and we did everything together—climbed trees, raced bicycles, and even built snow forts in winter.”

Emily leaned closer. “Did he give you this card when you were kids?
